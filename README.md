# Player Modeling with Artificial Intelligence in a Cooperative Setting

## Abstract

This work explores the innovative application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in player modeling within cooperative video game environments. 
It focuses on predicting players’ interaction preferences using AI analysis of gameplay patterns. 
The study hinges on a social interaction model, classifying players into distinct interaction styles based on the dimensions **Focus** and **Challenge**. 
It employs a **model-free**, **data-driven approach**, utilizing machine learning techniques such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**, to analyze gameplay data and classify player interactions. 
This research contributes to enhancingplayer engagement and the design of more immersive, personalized gaming experiences, thereby enriching the cooperative gaming landscape.

**Keywords** — Player Modeling, Player Experience, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cooperative Environments
